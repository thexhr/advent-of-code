Code I wrote for the Advent of Code - https://adventofcode.com/

Code is public domain, so use as you wish.

If you're on a BSD you can compile the code with

```
make foo
```

where foo is the name of the C file without the ending.  Otherwise,
compile it as follows:

```
$ cc -Wall -Wextra foo.c
$ ./a.out
```
